# Choice of client framework
Name: Angelena Marciano // Course: CSCI 459
Angular 

# Status: Accepted

# Context: 

Build a docker image and container set using Ansible plabook instead of docker-compose file in order to run application and display a web page with data to the browser.


# Decision:

At first I was weary about using a framework I did not have much prior experience with, but one of my classmates expressed their trust and usability within the framework, so I gave it a shot.
Angular has many advantages as a framework. One being it modifies the page DOM directly instead of adding inner HTML code. 
Angular is one of the most popular frameworks available for use with Javascript. It was built with an MVC design, meaning it uses static HTML files for the view which then corresponds to a typescript class which defines the component's business logic (controller).
It is also spported by Google and backed by a great development community, enabling me to easily google any issues I ran into.
I decided to use a template to build my angular app. From this template,I was able to edit all aspects of the code to fit my needs. I was able to incorporate my aesthetic design ability into my work, which was my favorite aspect of building the app.


# Consequences: 

If never used before, Angular is not simple like learning HTML and requires a real time devotion.
I was ran into a number of issues/erors that took quite some time to determine and deal with, which was highly frustrating, but that is part of life in coding. 
I continued to debug and edit my code throughout the assignment, finding small errors throughout the way that I was able to tweak to fit my needs and produce an output I am happy with.
After solving all my issues, I reached my final product which successfully runs all containers, and thus displays all my 'Dog' data in my web app, as defined by my Mongo  in an easy-to-read table view.
