# Choice of client framework
Name: Angelena Marciano // Course: CSCI 459

# Status: Accepted

# Context: 

Build a docker image and container using docker-compose in order to display a web page with data to the browser. 


# Decision:

At first I was weary about using a framework I did not have much prior experience with, but one of my classmates expressed their trust and usability within the framework, so I gave it a shot.
Angular has many advantages as a framework. One being it modifies the page DOM directly instead of adding inner HTML code. 
Angular is one of the most popular frameworks available for use with Javascript. It is also spported by Google and backed by a great development community, enabling me to easily google any issues I ran into.
I decided to use a template to build my angular app. From this template,I was able to edit all aspects of the code to fit my needs. I was able to incorporate my aesthetic design ability into my work, which was my favorite aspect of building the app.


# Consequences: 

I was ran into a number of issues/erors that took quite some time to determine and deal with, which was highly frustrating. 
I continued to debug and edit my code throughout the assignment, finding small errors throughout the way that I was able to tweak to fit my needs and produce an output I am happy with.
After solving all my issues, I reached my final product which successfully runs all containers, and thus displays all my 'Dog' data in my web app in an easy-to-read table view.
