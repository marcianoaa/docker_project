# Choice of Web Server Framework
Name: Angelena Marciano // Course: CSCI 459


# Context: 

Build a docker image and container using docker-compose in order to display a web page with data to the browser.


# Decision:

I chose to use Express JS as my web server with my angular application for a few reaons. 
The first being that it is a free commercial open source software that is easy to use when building modern day applications and is designed specifically for building web applications and APIs, hence why I chose it for my angular app.
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
Express will 'listen' for any input/connection requests from clients.
Although I have never used it before, I felt comfortable testing it out with my personal web app.


# Consequences: 

The Express JS server in my web application enabled me to collect input from the user, interpret it, and execute the correct response automatically.
After working out some kinks in my code due to making changes to the template, I was able to easily perform my CRUD operations directly in the web browser, which was incredibly easy and beneficial to see real-time change.
