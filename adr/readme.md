# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
Name: Angelena Marciano // Course: CSCI 459

This directory contains the ADRs for my docker container.

- My ADRs are named using a sequential number and description.

- There are ADR's on each decision made while building my web app, including angular, mongo, and express.

- My application was built off of a template found on the web. The template is based on [Michael Nygard's template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_by_michael_nygard.md).
